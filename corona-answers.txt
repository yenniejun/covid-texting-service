Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections
COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus was unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms include aches, pains, headache, sore throat, loss of taste or smell
If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor your symptoms
People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth
COVID-19 is mainly spread through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing or has other symptoms such as fever or tiredness. 
Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others and yourself. 
If you have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19, you may be infected. In these cases, it is best to stay at home. 
Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places. 
Self-quarantine means to separate yourself from others because you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 even though you, yourself, do not have symptoms
Quarantine means restricting activities or separating people who are not ill themselves but may have been exposed to COVID-19.
Research indicates that children and adolescents are just as likely to become infected as any other age group and can spread the disease
Regularly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Maintain at least 1 meter distance between yourself and others
There are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics
Those caring for individuals who are sick with COVID-19 should wear a medical mask for protection. 
Before touching the mask, clean hands. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the colored side)
The time between exposure to COVID-19 and the moment when symptoms start is commonly around five to six days but can range from 1 – 14 days
COVID-19 is spread through human-to-human transmission. The possible animal source of COVID-19 has not yet been confirmed but research is ongoing
We are still learning about the virus that causes COVID-19, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations
The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they can easily be cleaned with common household disinfectants that will kill the virus
When grocery shopping, keep at least 1-metre distance from others and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose
Fruits and vegetables are important components of a healthy diet. Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw
Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work
While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in faeces in some cases, there have not been reports of faecal-oral transmission of COVID-19
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase. (Sometimes this effect is described as “backfill.”)
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats
COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest)
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks
Regularly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Stay home if you feel unwell
CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19
Currently there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers
Hydrogen peroxide-based systems for cleaning, disinfecting, and storing contact lenses should be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19
Children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community
Stay in touch with your child’s school. Many schools are offering lessons online. Review assignments from school and create a schedule for learning at home
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredients
Stay calm. Protect yourself and others. Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close contact with others as much as possible
It is possible to test positive for flu (as well as other respiratory pathogens) and the virus that causes COVID-19 at the same time
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected
Viral tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs
Antibody testing checks a sample of a person’s blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus (immunity)
Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19
Stock up on supplies. Take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others. Limit close contact and wash your hands often. Avoid crowds
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19
There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19
Cleaning with soap and water removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading infection. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces
Surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water at least daily
Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection
Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public
CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19
CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses can spread to people from the fur or hair of pets
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places
